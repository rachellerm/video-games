# Time Spent Playing Video Games in 2018. Is there cause for concern?

## Introduction
The objective was to design a visualisation that represented the relationships contained in complex data sets and adapt them to highlight ideas you I wanted to communicate. 

The World Health Organisation introduced ‘gaming disorder’ into the 11th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) (World Health Organisation, 2018). This grabbed my attention, so I choose video games as my subject matter. I was curious to know, if any existing data could shed some light on this subject matter. After some research, I found an interesting table of summarised statistical data on the number of hours gamers spent playing each week. This statistical data was published on the web as part of the State of Online Gaming 2018 market research report (Limelight Networks, Inc. 2018). The data source summarised at least two variables (average hours played per week and age groups) and was not linked to an existing data visualisation. The purpose of my visualisation was to answer this question: How many hours each week do video gamers spend playingvideo games? The data visualisation is carefully crafted to facilitate the telling of video game play.
